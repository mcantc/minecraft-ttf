## Choosing your target font
Replace '\assets\minecraft\textures\font\ascii.png' to your texture pack's desired font texture (has to also be "ascii.png")
Open '\cache\minecraft.jar' with 7zip
Change lines '114' and '130 's' values for font formatting preferences (letter spacing and height)


### Minecraft TTF

This python script converts Minecraft: Java Edition [font definition files](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Font#Providers) to [TrueType Fonts (TTFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType).

By default, the script downloads the latest snapshot jar, reads all the font definitions, and generates regular, bold, italic, and bold italic font files corresponding to each. Currently, that includes `default` (the normal game font), `alt` (the enchantment table font), `illageralt` (an unused font from Minecraft Dungeons), and `uniform` (which is empty, see below).

Other Minecraft TTFs floating around tend to be outdated (using the pre-1.13 bitmap) or don't contain the complete set of characters. Using this script will ensure you have a perfectly matching set.

The `ttf` and `unihex` providers are not supported. Vanilla does not use the `ttf` provider, but it does use the `unihex` provider to create the `uniform` font and add fallbacks to the `default` font. Merging in the entirety of [GNU Unifont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Unifont) is useful for vanilla text, but is contrary to the goals of this project.

#### Display Tips

These fonts are very accurate, and should look good in any program that uses vector graphics to draw text at any scale. When rasterizing text in programs like [GIMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP), the font will be pixel-perfect accurate when its height is set to a multiple of 12 pixels. Make sure the line and letter spacing are whole integers.

These TTFs can be imported back into Minecraft with a `ttf` provider, and perfectly match the vanilla fonts. Make sure to use a `size` of 12 instead of the default 11. Italic text will be antialiased; you can increase `oversample` to around 4 to make it a closer match.
